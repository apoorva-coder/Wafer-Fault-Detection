# Wafer-Fault-Detection
This is a classification problem statement where the wafers have to be classified as work or not working depending upon values of 519 sensors. If a wafer stops working in between then the consequent process have to be stopped and checked. With huge production this is tedious and time consuming process. Hence, monitoring and replacing the wafers would help in resolving this problem.

Dataset : Provided by real-time client in the form of batches of csv files. The file has to match the schema provided by the company else that file will be discarded.
